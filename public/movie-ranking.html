<h2>According to Georgiana</h2>
<hr />

   <h3>One Piece</h3> 
   <p> One Piece is the best story ever told, from every point of view.</p>

   <h3>Demon Slayer</h3> 
   <p>Breathtaking landscapes and animations, with very well-developed characters.</p>

   <h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>
   <p>I really enjoyed seeing the growth and evolution of the characters compared to the first season. </p>
